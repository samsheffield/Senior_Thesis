# Development
Hello! Today, we'll meet as a group to...
- Review game design overview documents and scheduling
- Work, work, work, work, work.

## Project check-ins: Share prototyping/research from this week
What progress did you make on your project this week? What can you show us?

---

## Upcoming opportunity to collaborate!
Some students at Peabody are interested in talking about your games in a couple of weeks and potentially collaborating on some music/sound design. Film and game scoring is their thing, by the way

They are unable to meet on Tuesday, but can meet on Monday, February 26th in the afternoon with anyone who might be interested. __Will that work for anyone?__


## Class visit in 2 weeks
Sterf, a MICA alum and Lead Producer at Series AI (and formerly at Captain.TV and Big Huge Games) will be here to playtest your games in the morning and give a professional talk at noon.

_Please be prepared to bring your lunch that day or take a lunch break after the talk._
 


# Homework

## Development

Follow your schedules, delegate tasks, and get some work done. 

_In addition to giving as a morning status update, please have some progress to demonstrate next week._
