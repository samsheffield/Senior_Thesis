# Development
Hello! Today, we'll meet as a group to...
- Work session & playtesting
- Guest visitor: Karen Chang (Medstar Health and Studio217)


## Class visit: Jabari Weathers
Jabari will be visiting our class to playtest your games and talk about their work at noon. 


## Next Monday: IGDA Student Showcase @ MICA (6-9pm)

We're hosting a cross-institutional student showcase with the local chapter of IGDA on Monday, April 15th and we've saved each of your teams a spot to show off your thesis work. 

### Preparation
- Make sure to have at least one team member there to demo your game.
- __Set up begins after 3pm. Please arrive no later than 4:30 to set up your game.__
- Melanie is coordinating table assignments for the event. Please find one of us when you arrive.
- We'll have monitors, but please bring your laptops and any other tech you might need.

### Other considerations
- Can you describe your game succinctly in two to three sentences? 
- Do you need business cards? QR codes to LinkedIn or itch.io?
