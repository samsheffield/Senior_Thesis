# Development
Hello! Today, we'll meet as a group to...
- Playtesting
- Guest visitor: Sterf

## Project check-ins: Share prototyping/research from this week
What progress did you make on your project this week? What can you show us?

---

## Class visit: Sterf
Sterf, a MICA alum and Lead Producer at Series AI (and formerly at Captain.TV and Big Huge Games) will be here to playtest your games in the morning and give a professional talk at noon.

_Please be prepared to bring your lunch that day or take a lunch break after the talk._

## Next Monday: Upcoming opportunity to collaborate!
Some students at Peabody are interested in talking about your games in a couple of weeks and potentially collaborating on some music/sound design. Film and game scoring is their thing, by the way.

__We'll meet here from 3-4 on Monday. Please let me know if you are unable to make it.__


## Playtesting Documentation Guidelines
After each out-of-class playtesting session, you will need to provide documentation of testing. This should include a narrative summary describing the results of the testing (specifically, what you were testing, whether the results of testing met your expectations, and a description of your next actionable steps). 

In addition to this narrative summary, please provide any of the following documentation:
- Photo or video documentation of the playtesting session
- Completed playtesting forms

### What to turn in
This documentation should be uploaded to a Google Drive folder, clearly labeled as “NAME OF GAME Playtesting MMDDYY”. Only one copy of this document needs to be shared per team.

There is a Canvas Assignment for each playtest. Each team member will need to share the link to the Drive folder there.
