We're hosting a cross-institutional student showcase with the local chapter of IGDA on April 15th and we've saved each of your teams a spot to show off your thesis work. Many local schools with Game Design programs will be participating and we're encouraging members of the local game development community to come in to meet you all, play your games, and give you a little feedback!

_This coincidentally falls the same week your development is supposed to wrap up._
