# Development
Hello! Today, we'll meet as a group to...
- Quick progress check
- Class visitors: Presentations by Interactive Arts students

## Project check-ins: Share prototyping/research from this week
What progress did you make on your project this week? What can you show us? 5 minutes each group

## Class visit: Give IA Seniors feedback 
At 10:30, we'll be taking a look at the IA Seniors' thesis work and giving feedback. Then, after Spring Break, they'll return the favor by playtesting your games!

## Upcoming/future event: IGDA Student Showcase @ MICA (Monday, April 15th 6-9pm)
We're hosting a cross-institutional student showcase with the local chapter of IGDA on April 15th and we've saved each of your teams a spot to show off your thesis work. Many local schools with Game Design programs will be participating and we're encouraging members of the local game development community to come in to meet you all, play your games, and give you a little feedback!

_This coincidentally falls the same week your development is supposed to wrap up._

# Homework

## Spring Break
Take a break.

## Catch up on development
Falling behind schedule? Take advantage of some time around the break to get caught up. __You need fully playtestable prototypes next time we meet.__
