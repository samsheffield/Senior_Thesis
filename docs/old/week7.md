# Development
Hello! Today, we'll meet as a group to...
- Check progress
- Class visitor: Andrea Dixon from MICA Exhibitions

## Project check-ins: Share prototyping/research from this week
What progress did you make on your project this week? What can you show us?

---

## Class visit: Andrea Dixon @ 1PM
Andrea Dixon from Exhibtions will be visiting this afternoon to discuss the ArtWalk/Commencement Exhbition.

## Next Monday (03/04): Upcoming opportunity to collaborate!
Students from Peabody will visit MICA from 3-4 to discuss potential colaborations with you on your Senior Projects. We'll meet here or in the Game Lab.

_I'll send out a reminder over the weekend._

## Playtesting Documentation Guidelines
After each out-of-class playtesting session, you will need to provide documentation of testing. This should include a narrative summary describing the results of the testing (specifically, what you were testing, whether the results of testing met your expectations, and a description of your next actionable steps). 

In addition to this narrative summary, please provide any of the following documentation:
- Photo or video documentation of the playtesting session
- Completed playtesting forms

### What to turn in
This documentation should be uploaded to a Google Drive folder, clearly labeled as “NAME OF GAME Playtesting MMDDYY”. Only one copy of this document needs to be shared per team.

There is a Canvas Assignment for each playtest. Each team member will need to share the link to the Drive folder there.

## Next week: Give IA Seniors feedback 
Next week after our check-ins we'll be taking a look at the IA Seniors' thesis work and giving feedback. Then, after Spring Break, they'll return the favor by playtesting your games!
