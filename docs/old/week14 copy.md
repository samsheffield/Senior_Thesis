## Itch.io

### Make sure your game is ready to share
This work needs to be *portfolio ready* before uploading and sharing media on itch.io. - __Please have everything uploaded by midnight on Tuesday evening next week__ and share the link with me via email to confirm.

### Publishing Expectations
Your completed game needs to be published on itch.io and include descriptive text, compelling screengrabs (or images), and a short promotional video trailer. Downloadable builds for PC and Mac are expected, and WebGL builds are encouraged.

NOTE: If your game is going to be hosted online elsewhere (or is not hostable), please use itch.io as a gateway to it so that we can archive it and help share with our community.

### Non-digital or experimental game?
If you are making anything other than a conventional video game, the itch.io page will serve as a gateway to your project and documentation. Please produce informative and compelling documentation of the game's installation and critical components instead of providing a downloadable build.

### More information

#### On your itch.io page:
Focus on these details...
- Describe your game (What do you do? What do you think is novel or interesting about it? )
- Who made it (What role(s) did you play? Where else can you be found online?)
- Builds (downloadable, embedded web build, or link to actual hosted project)
- Cover image which serves as a banner for your page (630 x 500px)
- Media (For example: screenshots, gifs, installation photos, a short video trailer)

#### What kind of media?
You get to decide! Can you communicate what's special about your game with just images and words? Is your game complex or difficult to describe without showing it in action?

At minimum, you should have screenshots or photos which are evocative and interesting. _There is no minimum or maximum number._ Create a small set that says something about your game and generates excitement or interest in what you've made, so it's better to have fewer images which look good together and spark curiousity than many redundant/similar images. Also, you do not need to include a screenshot of the title screen. I know it's tempting if you've made a good one. Take advantage of itch.io's cover image to show off any log you've made for your game. 

#### But what about video or gifs?
Games which are complex or feature dynamic gameplay benefit _greatly_ from dynamic media (gifs or short videos). Interactive fiction, on the other hand, does not. I'd like you to put energy in areas that seem relevant to the work you've made.

_If you decide to make gifs of a video trailer keep in mind the following things..._

These shouldn't be straightforward walkthroughs of your game. Instead, create dynamic media which highlights the things which you think are  important to what you've made but are difficult to show in still images. Perhaps they create a mood or reflect the tone of your game? Maybe they show off great moments in your game? Maybe they serve as documentation for something site-specific of ephemeral? 

_Not feeling confident in your edting skills?_ Keep it short and simple (no more than 30-60 seconds). Video game trailers tend to follow pretty simliar formulas. Derek Lieu has a great series on producing game trailers. His [5 simple game trailer templates video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRvEFwHXm8s&t=202s) is a good place to start.


#### Don't overthink it
- Make sure anything you upload actually works (most important)
- Have good media which supports and shows your game in the best light (also incredibly important)
- Use descriptive and compelling language to describe your game (what do you think is exciting or interesting about it?) 
- Itch.io tags and genre labeling can help others find your game (it's surprisingly effective)
- Thinking about designing the itch.io page? Focus on keeping it simple and attractive

## Presentations
Each team is responsible for creating a short presentation on their game __no longer than 15 minutes__ in length. Use Powerpoint, Keynote, or Google Slides to organize your talk.

### Each presentation should include...
- Title of your game
- Names of team members & their roles.
- A 2-3 sentence description which succinctly and excitedly describes your game.
    - What kind of game is it? (Genre(s), play style)
    - What is your game's theme & setting?
    - What is your game's hook? (What's one novel, fun, or interesting thing about it? What are you proud of?)
- Inspiration
    - 3 significant precedents for your game. This can be a mix of games and non-games media (animation, film, books, stories, music, etc.)
    - Give examples of what you learned from these or how you used them as precedents for your own work.
- Development Process Overview
    - Tell us about the development of your project. Where did it come from? How did it get to where it is? Show us pictures.
- Any plans for your game's future development?

### Want to practice?
 _Practice beforehand._ Do not improvise or wing it. I'm happy to meet online this week of over the weekend if you want to practice your presentation. Email me a request and we'll schedule it.

## Presskits
Each team is responsible for providing documentation of your work in the form of a press kit. This will include a written description, still images, and a small video trailer/demo.

The purpose of a presskit to have all the information that someone might need to know about your game, easily organized in one place. Presskits allow you to drive the narrative of your work when reaching out to people to discuss your game and will have much of the same information as on your itch.io page.

### What should a presskit include?
A presskit should be a document (Google Doc or PDF) which includes:
- Copy: A description of your game and who made it.
- Contact information: contact information for the team, including an email address.
- Images: 9-12 high quality images (screenshots, logos, artwork)
- Videos: A short trailer and (possibly) edited videos of gameplay

Here are a couple of online examples ([Octodad](https://younghorsesgames.com/press/sheet.php?p=octodad_dadliest_catch) and [Shovel Knight](https://www.igdb.com/games/shovel-knight/presskit)).

### How to make a presskit?
There are several online tools ([here](https://dopresskit.com/) and [here](https://impress.games/press-kitty), for example) that you can use to create HTML presskits, but my recommendation is to not worry about that and simply use the template to create your own, hosted in either a non-MICA Google Drive or Dropbox folder.


## Beyond itch.io & presskits? Portfolio Development Tips for Game Designers
Itch.io is a great home for your digital work, but sometimes you need a little more room to talk about _you_. While it's important when searching for opportunities to have materials available, you don't need to overthink this:

### Keep it simple

One of the most daunting things about collecting your work online is sometimes the feeling that you need a super unique website. _You don't._ For most people, simple and straightforward is going to work best. This is in line with the guidance for resumes.


### You portfolio should tell people...
1. Who you are.
2. What you can do (by highlighting specific examples).
3. How people can connect with you.

### What to show

1. Show the best work you have that shows off what you can do. 
2. Prioritize completed work over unfinished things. 
3. It is _far better_ to have fewer, high quality examples of your best work than many examples of varying quality.
4. Variety is good.

### Give things space
You will often tailor your resume to the jobs you are applying to. Having a portfolio site where projects are organized on individual pages will make it significantly easier to highlight skills that are relevant to specific positions.

### Three things that do not matter...
1. Where you host your site (It's okay to use a sitebuilder like [squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com), [wix](https://www.wix.com), [adobe portfolio](https://portfolio.adobe.com), [wordpress](https://wordpress.com))
2. The URL (people will find you through search engines, social networks, itch.io, linkedin, etc.). 
3. Unique/clever web design (Use a sitebuilder if you don't already have web design skills)

### Should you pay money for this?

- Paid hosting & dedicated URL signal a degree of professionalism, but they are not mandatory. 
- Paid webhosting specifically can sometimes remove branding/advertising which you might find confusing or don't want to be connected with.

### No one is looking for your website (most of the time!)
- People are looking for you when they find you elsewhere and want more information
- Social media and participation in other networks/communities is valuable (but you get to pick your communities and your engagement level!)
- Have things ready and don't wait for an opportunity to arrive to begin preparing materials
