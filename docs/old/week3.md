# Pre-production: Game Design Overview Document
Hello! Today, we'll meet as a group to...
- Discuss game design overview document
- One-on-one meetings

## Project check-ins: Share prototyping/research from this week
What progress did you make on your project this week? Did you participate in Global Game Jam? What did you make?

## 1-on-1 meetings: 
Let's meet to reconnect with your goals and preliminary plans heading into this semester. 

We will also discuss your macro charts together. Please submit the link to Canvas if you have not done so already. __Each team member.__

## Game Design Overview Document

You have already communicated _so much_ with your game design macro chart. The last document that you will be producing, called a _game design overview_, will accompany the macro chart to introduce the most important game design and narrative elements in your game. We are using this approach as an alternative to a monolithic game design document/bible.

### What is the goal?
The functions of the game design overview is as a means of communicate the project goals and creative vision to all members of a development team. This document should contain enough detail to provide clarity.


### A special note regarding our particular context
Due to the limitations of our semester schedule, our development process is condensed and somewhat messy (we're doing a lot of work in parallel). 

Additionally, you're all working on very small teams, so much of the communication goal behind this document is already ingrained in your working patterns. You've undoubtedly discussed your design goals and the creative direction of your game with your teammate(s).

With that in mind, prepare this document so that it lays out the creative vision and design plans you have established for your game so that you can ensure everyone is headed towards the same goal in development.


### Structure
The game design overview document should cover all key areas relative to the game you are making. Your game may have some key areas which are highly specific to it. 

We'll use the proposed structure below as a starting point. Please add to it as needed.


#### 1. Description
In just a few sentences, describe your game to someone who hasn't played it.

Here are some details to consider:
- Who are we in the game and what do we do?
- What kind of game is it? (Genre(s), play style)
- What is your game's theme & setting?
- What is your game's hook?
- Use specific language that describes the feeling/character of your game.
- Avoid direct references to other games.

#### 2. The "Three C's": Character, camera, and control
Briefly describe your game's main character, how the game is rendered, and how it is controlled.

Describe the main character:
- Who or what is the player? 
- What is their backstory? 
- What is their motivation?

Describe how your game is rendered:
- What does a player see? 
- Is it a 2D game, a 3D first person game, isometric 2.5D game?

Describe how your game is controlled:
- Does it use a keyboard, a game pad, or a new novel physical interface?


#### 3. Overview of your game's mechanics
Describe what a player does in the game:
- What are the core mechanics? 
- What other supporting activities are there?
- Be mindful of the verbs you use to describe the actions in your game.

#### 4. Establishment of your game's pillars
Game pillars are the core statements that encapsulate the overall concept of the game you are making.
- 3-5 pillars will suffice.
- Use the player experience goals you've identified in your game design macro chart as guidance for this.
- Use short sentences with active (positive) language that focus on how a player will feel.


#### 5. Overview of the game's narrative elements
Provide an overview of the game's plot (if there is a story). 
- What happens over the course of the entire game? 
- Don't worry about "spoiling" the game by revealing the plot. This is for your team, so they should know what they are making!

Provide an introduction to any key characters in your game.
- Who are the characters?
- What is their relationship to the player?


#### Art direction
Show or describe the art direction of your game. 
- What are the aesthetic goals for the art direction?
- Describe the tone or mood you are trying to accomplish. 
- What is the inspiration?
- Here is an opportunity to show any key or concept art.
- **Don't forget to describe the sound design and music.**
- **Don't forget your game's graphic design.**


## Today: Create a game design overview document for your game
Work with other members of your team to begin developing a game design overview document to accompany your game design macro chart. 

_Additionally, now is the time to revisit your design macro chart and prioritized task list to make sure everything is in alignment before we head into a development phase next week._


# Homework

## Complete your pre-production documentation and propose a development schedule: 

### Finish pre-production documents

Work with your team to...
1. Complete your game design overview document.
2. Realign your other pre-production documentation.

### Prepare a development schedule
Create a spreadsheet to schedule the 9 weeks of development of your game. 
- Use your prioritized task list and game design macro as a guide for this work.
- Please refer to [our class schedule](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zERo4_Udrk43SyrUX2A9VRs9Ck42KIv1kYG6JIPoSwI/edit?usp=sharing) for deadlines and in-class playtesting.
- Factor in time for playtesting and troubleshooting.
- Remember to schedule 3 out of class playtesting sessions.

**Each team member is responsible for sharing a link to the completed overview document and the development schedule spreadsheet to the Canvas assignments (Game Design Overview Document and Development Schedule).**



### Need to prototype?
- Identify (at least) one aspect of your game which is critical to your game and make a small prototype which tests its viability. 
- Put a link to the prototype in your dev log entry for this week and describe:
    - Why you made this prototype.
    - What additional prototypes would benefit you at this stage of development.


### Need to research?
- Identify some aspect of your game which you want to know more about and conduct some research on it.
- Be sure to document your research and what you learned.

_You do not need to submit these anywhere. We will check-in next week and you can discuss your work then._
