## Upcoming/future event: IGDA Student Showcase @ MICA (Monday, April 15th 6-9pm)
We're hosting a cross-institutional student showcase with the local chapter of IGDA on April 15th and we've saved each of your teams a spot to show off your thesis work. Many local schools with Game Design programs will be participating and we're encouraging members of the local game development community to come in to meet you all, play your games, and give you a little feedback!

_This coincidentally falls the same week your development is supposed to wrap up._

## Class visit next week: Jabari Weathers
Jabari Weathers is an illustrator, writer, and tabletop game designer who has worked on games such as Bluebeard's Bride and the 3rd Edition of Betrayal at House on the Hill. Jabari will be here to playtest your games in the morning and give a professional talk at noon.

_Please be prepared to bring your lunch that day or take a lunch break after the talk._

# Homework

Follow your schedules, delegate tasks, and get some work done. Have something playtestable for next week.

_In addition to giving as a morning status update, please have some progress to test next week._
