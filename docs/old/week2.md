# Pre-production: Game Design Macro & Burndown Charts
Hello! Today, we'll meet as a group to...
- Discuss game design macros
- One-on-one meetings

## Project check-ins: Share prototyping/research from this week
What progress did you make on your project this week? 

## 1-on-1 meetings: 
Let's meet to reconnect with your goals and preliminary plans heading into this semester. 

We will also discuss your prioritized task list together. Please submit the link to Canvas if you have not done so already. __Each team member.__

## Guiding development with a game design macro
A game design macro represents an overview of our game's design, listing all important aspects in a compact way. It typically consists of two parts- a game design overview and a game design macro chart. We'll focus on the latter this week.

In commercial game development settings, this approach has replaced the once common monolithic game design document as key to game design planning. Macros are developed at the end of the pre-production phase of a game's development, and once completed, macros are typically _set in stone_ with very little deviation during the game's development.

### Macro not Micro
The game design macro isn't concerned with describing small details, instead providing just enough detail to steer development in a clear and compact way. Once finished, it serves as a map for your development, able to provide all important quantitative aspects of your game at a glance.
This approach makes the game design macro not only effective at communicating our game design ideas, but it also makes it an instrumental tool in scheduling development. 

### Game design macro chart
The game design macro chart is simply a spreadsheet or table which provides a step-by-step breakdown of a game. It includes information on a game's content, actions, narrative progression, and emotional beats. 

[Here's a nice template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HHgzKnf3q6_eWLwdr2nA7_0GeJer2VZG9YJxq2f7IW4/edit?usp=sharing) by Richard Lemarchand, an educator at USC and former game designer at Naughty Dog. Lemarchand has a great overview of this process in his book, A Playful Production Process (which is also an excellent introduction to the structure and processes of commercial game development!)

#### Macro chart organization
The organization of the chart is realtively straightforward:
- Rows: The vertical axis of the chart represents time and is organized sequentially (except when a game has a nonlinear structure). This includes _all_ parts of the game, from start to finish, including title screens, bumpers, menus, and credits.
- Columns: The horizontal axis lists important information relevant to the design of each part of the game. _Note: the ones provided in the template are probably good for most games in this class, but if your game does not require a column listed, substitute it with something more relevant._

#### Rows
Using this simple structure, _each row_ will describe the following for each part of the game:
- The environment or setting
- The characters and objects
- The type of gameplay which takes place there
- What a player has to do or can do there
- What is happening in the game's narrative

 Let's take a look, discuss what information might go in each column, and look at a couple of examples.

#### Columns
The columns in the chart provide the structure for describing this important information. In the template, these include:

- **Location/sequence name**: The title for the row which describe where the events take place.
- **Time of day/Weather/Mood**: What is the mood and/or setting for these events? Useful for art production.
- **Brief Description of Events**: A brief description of what happens at this point, both from gameplay and narrative perspectives. _Keep it brief._
- **Player Mechanics**: What actions are available to a player at this point in the game? This should highlight not only new and novel mechanics, but _all things_ a player can do here. Useful for designing gameplay.
- **Characters encountered**: All of the characters a player encounters in this part of the game. This is _every character_, not just NPCs.
- **Objects Encountered**: What objects are found in this part of the game? These might be gameplay related or narrative focused things.
- **Other Assets**: The audio, visual art, and animation needed to flesh out this part of the game. Often related to things in the background. This is a good place to note anything which may be time-consuming to create.
- **Audio Notes**: What kinds of sounds or music will be needed in this part of the game?
- **Visual Effects Notes**: What are the major visual effects (post-processing, particles, shaders, etc) needed in this part? Also a good place to note anything which may be time-consuming to create.
- **Player Goal**: These are the goals players set for themselves based on the cues they get from the game. What do you expect a player to want to do, or think they should be doing, in this part of the game?
- **Design Goal**: These are what you as the designer are trying to accomplish in this part of the game. For example: are we traching the player something, testing their ability, or introducing them to a key character, revealing something that marks an important part in the plot?
- **Emotional Beat**: 
What would you like a player to be feeling in this part of the game? While we can't _make_ someone feel somthing, we can make design decisions to encourage certain emotions. [Dr. Plutchik's Wheel of Emotions](https://www.6seconds.org/2022/03/13/plutchik-wheel-emotions/) might be a good resource for identifying emotions.

## Burndown Chart
Your game design macro provides a highly detailed and prioritized  list that can be used to help manage development tasks which still need to be completed. 

A simple and effective approach to this, often referred to as a _burndown chart_, only requires striking off any completed task as it is completed. 


## Today: Create a game design macro chart for your game
Using [the template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HHgzKnf3q6_eWLwdr2nA7_0GeJer2VZG9YJxq2f7IW4/edit?usp=sharing) as a framework, create an overview of your game. 

- Copy the Google sheet to your own folder to edit it. Add rows as needed.
- Stick to the format unless you have other needs, in which case, you can make _some_ changes. Substitute, not delete, columns.

This is a draft. We'll review these together and you may need to make some adjustments to provide more clarity.


# Homework

## Two choices this week...
1. Finish Macro Chart + Global Game Jam (*why should you participate in this?*) Register [here](https://globalgamejam.org/jam-sites/2024/mica-game-design).
2. Finish Macro Chart + Prototyping/Research (*details below*)

### Need to prototype?
- Identify (at least) one aspect of your game which is critical to your game and make a small prototype which tests its viability. 
- Put a link to the prototype in your dev log entry for this week and describe:
    - Why you made this prototype.
    - What additional prototypes would benefit you at this stage of development.


### Need to research?
- Identify some aspect of your game which you want to know more about and conduct some research on it.
- Be sure to document your research and what you learned.

_You do not need to submit these anywhere. We will check-in next week and you can discuss your work then._


## Submit the link to your completed macro to Canvas
Each team member is responsible for submitting the link to your team's game design macro via this week's Canvas assignment.
