# Development
Hello! Today, we'll meet as a group to...
- Check-in
- Discuss resume and cover letter writing

## Project check-ins: Share prototyping/research from this week
What progress did you make on your project this week? What can you show us?

---

## Class visit next week: Sterf
Sterf, a MICA alum and Lead Producer at Series AI (and formerly at Captain.TV and Big Huge Games) will be here to playtest your games in the morning and give a professional talk at noon.

_Please be prepared to bring your lunch that day or take a lunch break after the talk._

## Upcoming opportunity to collaborate!
Some students at Peabody are interested in talking about your games in a couple of weeks and potentially collaborating on some music/sound design. Film and game scoring is their thing, by the way

They are unable to meet on Tuesday, but can meet on Monday, February 26th in the afternoon with anyone who might be interested. Please mark your calendars.



## Resume development resources
Today we'll discuss some approaches to resume development as game designers and developers/creative people.

Career Development can provide a lot of support in this area. Here are their resources ([link](https://www.mica.edu/career-development/career-resources/)).

# Homework

## Development

Follow your schedules, delegate tasks, and get some work done. Have something playtestable for next week.

_In addition to giving as a morning status update, please have some progress to demonstrate next week._
