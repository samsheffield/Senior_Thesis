# Fall '24 Senior Thesis!

## T O D A Y

### Progress Updates

Break into small groups and present your progress. Each person:
- Who you are
- Show/demonstrate what you are working on
- What you were/are trying to accomplish (ideas, goals, questions)
- What are your next steps

### Work Session & 1-on-1 Meetings
After sharing out, the remainder of the class will seesion will be a work session. I will also continue meeting with you 1-on-1 to check progress and get an update on our plans for the 1st Milestone next week.

### Collaboration?
Many people have shared conversations that they have had regarding potential colaborations, but if you are still interested in working with others but haven't made any preliminary plans, this should happen by the end of class next week. 

Otherwise, you will be expected to transition the work you have been doing into an individual thesis project in the second half of the semester.

__If you are struggling to find partners because your ideas are very specific, or if you feel like your current ideas are too big/ambitious to pursue independently, I would encourage you to approach this from a different angle:__

__Identify people who want to collaborate and then start brainstorming some ideas from the ground up together (true collaboration!)__

## Homework

### Milestone 1 (Next Week)
Next week, you will submit the culmination of your progress and work completed during the first half of the semester. This will consist of two parts:

1. __Work samples__. These will be work samples demonstrating the emerging body or work, prototypes, or other exploratory experiments that you have been working on. 

2. __Written statement__. Please include a written statement summarizing your work so far and how it relates to the body of work that you will continue to develop for Senior Thesis, either individually or in collaboration with others.

Please make sure things are shared in _friendly_ file formats (for example: jpegs, gifs, pdfs, mp4s). Unity project files are acceptable, but PC builds are preferred (if possible). Otherwise, create a small exported video clearly demonstrating what you been working on. 

Organize these files into folders as you see fit.

#### Where to submit work

Please create a folder named `lastname_firstname_seniorthesis1` in our class drive on the school's Picasso server. If you are unsure of how to connect to the server while on the MICA campus network, [please look here](https://www.mica.edu/campus-resources/technology/software/file-storage-servers/) for instructions.

#### Additionally...
We'll share out these summaries as a group next week, so be prepared to show highlights of what you've been working on and discuss plans for continuing individual or collaborative work.
