# Fall '24 Senior Thesis!

## Senior Thesis Project Milestone 2 (Due 12/03) 
The second milestone will be toward the end of the semester and coincide with the production of a project proposal presentation. This work will be representative of the project that a student will complete in the Spring semester. 

- For games, the goal for this milestone is a fully playable prototype or vertical slice. 
- For visual development work, this will be a portfolio of in-development work (concept art, key art, character design, etc.). 
- For all other work, students will meet with me to make a plan for deliverables.

## Project Proposal Presentations (Due 12/10)
Students will be responsible for preparing a presentation demonstrating the work you are proposing as your Senior Thesis Project. 

This presentation can be organized using any slideshow tool such as Powerpoint, Google Slides, or Keynote. It will include examples of relevant research, inspiration, prototypes and experiments, key or concept art, aand a proposed timeline for continued development in the Spring semester. 

Presentations can be completed collaboratively if you are working on a team, with each member providing insight into their particular role (or roles) in the project’s development.

If you intend to work on multiple projects (a mix of independent work and colaborative work), you will be required to prepare a presentation for each project.

__Detailed presentation guidelines will be provided by 11/19._

## Homework

### Continue development
The next two weeks are dedicated to planning and working.

For people collaborating with others, begin coordinating towards the end of semester goals _this week_. I will begin meeting with your team next week to discuss your plans.

### Sign up for a Progress Review date
There are 7 available slots each day for class review and discussion. Please do not add additional rows if your preferred day fills up.

Collaborators should sign up as a team, but if you are also working on independent work that you will continue to develop as a thesis project into the spring, sign up for an individual review session as well.
