# Fall '24 Senior Thesis!

## T O D A Y

### Self introductions
- Who are you?
- Show a few examples of your own work that you are excited about. *Tell us what you like, or find successful about it. (This can be collaborative work)*
- Show a few examples of work by others that you find inspiring. *Tell us what you find successful or inspiring about it.*
- Show something that you are currently working on that is related to the work you want to do in the first half of the semester in this class.
- Describe what you are currently considering for your Senior Thesis. This is not a proposal, so you don't need to have specific plans at this points.
- Are you currently considering collaboration? What skills do you have and how might you like to collaborate?

Be prepared for 5-10 minutes (Please manage your time).

### Interested in collaborating/experimenting with others?
Today's a good day to start having conversations. Remember, in the first half of the semester, you are not committed to any particular thesis idea. You can try collaborating on something small with others in this class to just get things started.

### Next Week
No class session. My apologies. I will be available for online meetings late in the afternoon/evening. See homework below for assignment that is due.

## Homework

### Due Next Week: Schedule/Work Plan for 1st Milestone

Please provide me with a synopsis of what you would like to accomplish (your goals) for the first milestone deadline (10/08) and a detailed weekly production schedule for the work you anticipate this requiring. This can be any format digital document (Google Docs, Google Sheets, etc.) shared as a link or directly uploaded to the Canvas assignment. 

### In two weeks: Have progress ready to share in small groups

Follow your work plan and have some progress to share out in small groups. If you are working on a game, you should have a small playable prototype to demonstrate.
